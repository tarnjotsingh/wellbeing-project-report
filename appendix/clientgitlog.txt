| 
|     Blocked question list when adding a new survey.
|     
|     * Added a conditional style option for the container that will display
|     the SurveyQuestionList.
|             * If a survey ID does not exist, then a style 'hidden' will be
|     applied to the container. Otherwise no style will be applied.
|     
|     * Just fixing some authentication stuff that wasn't saved before. This
|     prevents a dialog from appearing in the browser prompting the user to
|     enter username and password details for oauth2/client.
|     
|     * Minor formatting fixes.

| 
|     Resolving bugs
|     
|     * Hard coded bearer token rather than storing into localStorage just for
|     the sake of making it a bit more secure.
|     
|     * Issues with how Auth was provided, resolved mistakes in request
|     headers that prevented successful requests from occuring.

| 
|     Adding oauth authentication support
|     
|     * Adding AuthService which provides methods for obtaining an
|     access_token to make requests with.
|     
|     * Adding a LoginPage component that will call methods in the AuthService
|     to get a token and validate that the token is legitmate.
|     
|     * Editing components to make requests with bearer token.
|     
|     * Editing App.js to redirect users that try to access content without a
|     valid token. By default, to minimise lag, a quick check to see if the
|     bearer token has expired is done.

| 
|     Fixed add new question with choices.
|     
|     * Fixed code so that it correctly submits questions and question
|     choices.
|     
|     * Implemented methods to use async correctly in order to make the
|     requests syncronous (need to ensure that a question existed before
|     adding choices to it).
|     
|     * This also involved fixing java spring app, commit located here: https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk/gv009864/springboot-docker-mysql/commit/7bac7516029c6894924b7b9cce6a52dfa9b7f61c
|     
|     * Next step will be to implement a way to delete/remove question
|     choices.

| 
|     Able to continously add new questions.
|     
|     * Though bug introduced was that there are now duplicate choices now
|     being thrown into the database with null question id (forigen key). Need
|     to fix this.

| 
|     Choice editing almost fully working.
|     
|     * Can create a new question with associated choices.
|     
|     * Can edit existing choices
|     
|     * Can add new choicse for an existing question, though this
|     functionality is not fully working. Question view not properly updating
|     when the updated values are updated.

| 
|     Working to get question choice editing working.
|     
|     * Have started to use ReactTable as a way to get tables that can display
|     the question choice data and allow for inline editing of that data.
|     
|     * Having to re-adjust some of the code in order to get the question
|     choice stuff working as intended. Now passing in the entire response
|     (Question json that is returned by the server) as an argument for
|     updating and adding to a list.
|     
|     * Will need to now look into updating the back end (java springboot) to
|     incorporate the correct REST endpoints to allow updating and deletion of
|     question choices as a part of the question body as this will probably be
|     the easiest way to get this working.
|     
|     * Can also include the endpoints to manage the curd opeations on the
|     question choices alone but I do want to just add in new question choices
|     by doing a PUT/POST request with that question json body.
