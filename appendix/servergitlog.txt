| | 
| |     Can now refer to database to user information.
| |     
| |     * Users with hashed passwords (using BCrypt) can now be stored into the
| |     database under the users table.
| |         * By default the test user with password test will be created which
| |     can be used to authenticate and attain a JWT token.
| |     
| |     * JWT tokens are used for authorizing requests, at the moment values are
| |     hard-coded into the AuthroizationServerConfig but is good enough for
| |     now.
| |         * Can verify the validity of a JWT token by using https://jwt.io/
| |     
| |     * CustomUserDetails and CustomUserDetailsService implemented to find
| |     user data from the database via username and use it for authentication.
| |     
| |     * Users domain class has been simplified in order to get this working.
| |         * Ideally the next steps would be to add extra flexibility for roles
| |     so that different users can access different parts of the API.

|       Working spring-security done
|       
|       * Working with an in-memory client definition
|       
|       * Working with in-memory user credentials
|       
|       * Can now do a POST request against /oauth/token with
|       ** grant_type = password
|       ** username = in-mem-user
|       ** password = in-mem-user-pswd
|       
|       * Can validate the token by using the /oauth/check_token endpoint
|       ** token = asdfasdf     should return an error
|       ** token = valid-token  will return the user information for the user
|       that the token was assigned to.

| 
|     Adding READ access only to question choices.
|     
|     * Fixes issue where orphan choices were being created when submitting a
|     question (POST). If there were choices present in the JSON, Jackson was
|     also serializing the choices but did not assign those choices with
|     question ID so they became orphans.
|     
|     * Need to do this to maintain consistency. Did not want to use
|     questionChoices in question body to add the new choices.
|     
|     * Only want to use the POST method in /choices endpoint to add the new
|     questions to a question regarless if it is a new one or an existing one.
|     
|     ** Basically means that a question MUST EXIST before you any choices can
|     be added.

| 
|     Adding more choices REST endpoints.
|     
|     * Added another PUT endpoint that can PUT with an array of objects. Not
|     sure if this conforms to REST standards, but it is what it is.
|     
|     * Included cascade option to oneToMany relationship for choices in the
|     question class.
|     
|     * I think I may need to start breaking up the code to include interfaces
|     and have them implemented by service classes. Mostly for the sake of
|     organising the code and enabling code reuse in some areas where it may
|     be necessary.

|     Quesiton choice endpoints properly implemented to REST standards.
|     
|     * Choice endpoints have now been properly implemented to conform to REST
|     standards.
|     
|     * Have no tested, endpoints. Will need to test the endpoints out before
|     it can be said that the endpoints are working as intended.
|     
|     * Tweaked quesion endpoints to conform what I want to do with the front
|     end application.

| 
|     I have not been committing enough.
|     
|     - Enabled transactions in the configuration to allow custom repository
|     methods to work such as deleteByIdAndSurveyId().
|     
|     - Improved implementation in QuestionResource for managing questions.
|     I.e. REST paths make sense now that I learnt you can actually make
|     custom, derived, methods for poking at the database. E.g.
|     findByIdAndSurveyId() which lets you implement the REST path of
|     /api/surveys/{surveyId}/questions/{questionId}
|     
|     - Other genearl tweaks.
|     
|     - Need to avoid this fat committs lol.
|     
|     - Though then again this just for a uni project so not like anybody
|     cares really. Will be handy to go back and look at though!

| 
|     Fixed up the project so that it actually does what I want it to do.
|     
|     Entities are correctly created and schema present in database is updated as per the hibernate.ddl-auto value being set to update.
|     
|     rest controllers set up so that they return what is required, spring jpa is cool since it will just convert whatever is in the database into the correct JSoN

|     Can now successfully execute ./gradlew generateChangeLog to generate a change log file based on the java implementation via connecting to hibernate as a referenceUrl.
