    Abstract - Pressures from University life can cause a number of health issues in students.
    In some cases students may experience stress attributed to not understanding topic and meeting deadlines.
    Such an environment can also act as a catalyst for those that are already experiencing other issues outside of University.
    Stigmas around mental health could mean the individuals that suffer struggle to get in contact with people that can help.
    For those that do not suffer from such an illness, it may just be helpful for these students to keep track of their
    mental health situation and find ways to improve.
    With many applications being built for the modern web, this can be utilised to provide a modern day solution that provides 
    an anonymous way for students to keep track of their mental health.
