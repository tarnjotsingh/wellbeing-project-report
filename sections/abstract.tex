    Abstract - Pressures from University life can cause a number of health issues in students.
    In some cases students may experience stress attributed to not understanding topic and meeting deadlines.
    Such an environment can also act as a catalyst for those that are already experiencing other issues outside of University.
    Those that do not find themselves with the appropriate support may not have the confidence to arrange help sessions with their
    General Practitioner (GP) or any on-campus support groups. 
    In other situations, it may be helpful for students to assess their mental health situation and find ways to improve.
