\section{Literature Review}

In the early stages of this project research was conducted of existing literature and technologies to grasp a better understanding of the problem and what would be the best approach to solve it.
This section will cover the main areas that this project will focus on.

\subsection{Wellbeing of university students}

Since this report revolves around the topic of student wellbeing, it is important to establish a definition for the term "student wellbeing" to correctly approach the problem.
It is defined as a sustainable state of positive mood and attitude, resilience, and satisfaction with self, relationships and experiences at school \cite{noble2008scoping}.
The part referring to a sustainable state is important to focus on. All humans endure fluctuations their emotional state within their lives, but a real problem occurs when their emotional state is not sustainable.
There are many factors that can play into poor mental health. Stress tends to be one of the main issues. 
Stress arouses feelings of fear, incompetence, uselessness, anger and guilt \cite{turunen2014indoor}. 
To some, these attributes that stem from stress can act as a form of motivation, however not all are able to do such a thing.
Those that are unable to cope with stresses from university studies will, unfortunately, struggle to focus on assignments and revision for exams.
A study by HSBC, found a correlation between disadvantaged social circumstances with increased health risks \cite{currie2009social}.
While talking about students, it is important to recognise that there may be deeper stemmed issues within the lives of certain students that may affect them when entering higher education.

Most disorders that pertain to mental health first start developing between the ages of 15 and 20 years of age \cite{kessler2005lifetime}.
By taking this fact into account, 15\% to 20\% of individuals who fall into this category (youth\cite{youth2017definition}) are affect by some sort of mental disorder; the majority whom suffer from an anxiety order. 
The study, conducted by The university Of British Columbia, therefore came an approximate figure of 140,000 children and youth who suffer from a mental disorder. 
Considering that, in 2017/18, there were X number of youth that progress into higher education....

% Ways to measure the affects of the mental health of students

% How much of a problem is it among students and how does it affect them?



\subsection{Creating meaningful surveys}

\subsection{Backend technologies}
Covering topics of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Springboot
    \item RESTful APIs
    \item Microservice - might be worthwhile to look into breaking up user service from main service.
    \item Any other topics that pertain to how the backend has been built
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Frontend technologies}
Covering topics of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ReactJs for creating the front end
    \item Discuss why this javascript framework was chosen (how it can be ported to react native in the future for example...
\end{enumerate}
